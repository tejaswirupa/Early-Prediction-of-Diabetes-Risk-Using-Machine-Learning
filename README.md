# Early Prediction of Diabetes Risk Using Machine Learning
This project explores the potential of data science to enable early detection of diabetes using the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. Timely identification of at-risk individuals is crucial for effective intervention and prevention strategies, minimizing long-term health complications and healthcare costs.

Leveraging a comprehensive dataset curated by the CDC, we applied statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, and quadratic models to uncover key patterns and risk factors such as blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol levels, and general health. Our predictive model categorizes individuals based on their diabetes risk, enabling proactive healthcare measures.

By integrating powerful visualization and classification techniques, this project empowers healthcare professionals to recognize high-risk populations and deploy targeted health interventions. Ultimately, it demonstrates the impact of data-driven methodologies on improving diagnostic accuracy and public health outcomes.
